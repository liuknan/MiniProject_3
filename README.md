# MiniProject_3
## Preparation
For this project, beside modules in MiniProject 1, you need to import both pymysql and pymongo.
Then, you need to install both MySQL and MongoDB, since they would be operated at the same time when you were using this program.
You also need  to keep MySQL and MongoDB on while using the program.
At last, you have to add your own google credential and twitter API Key to MiniProject 1.

## How to Use
You could try the python file named MiniProject_3.py for this project. When you start the program, it will ask you to input your name, then
you need to input the twitter account you want to check. If the account is invalid, you need to reinput your name and another twitter account.
And the program will downloads some pictures from the twitter account you want automatically. And then, you could input detect to know labels 
for the images, input video to convert images to a video or you can input search to search some specific things in the database. The next
 step is to input the things you want, like you could input MT kobebryant for the transactions of anyone who checked information about 
 kobebryant in the MongoDB. "M" for MongoDB, "S" for MySQL, "T" for transactions, "L" for Labels. At last, anytime you want to exit the program
, just type "exit".
